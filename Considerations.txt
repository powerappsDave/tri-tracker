You're on a good path for building a triathlon training tracker app with the following stack:

Node.js API: for backend logic and serving data

TypeScript frontend: for safety, scalability, and modern features

SQLite3: lightweight and easy to set up for local or small-scale use

âœ… This stack is sufficient for:
Building a MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Handling basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for workouts, schedules, metrics

Running the app locally or in a small production setup

ðŸ”§ Suggested Additions & Considerations
1. Frontend Framework
Unless you're writing everything from scratch (which is fine), using a framework can speed things up:

React + Vite + TypeScript â€“ fast dev experience

Or Next.js (React-based) â€“ if you want SSR or API routes too

2. Database Considerations
SQLite is great to start, but:

Use PostgreSQL or MySQL if you plan to scale or go multi-user.

Consider using Prisma ORM or TypeORM with TypeScript for typed database access.

3. Authentication & Authorization
If users will log in or store private data:

Use JWT tokens or session-based auth (like Passport.js)

Consider OAuth if you want to integrate with fitness platforms (Strava, Garmin, etc.)

4. API
Use REST (standard and fine)

Or consider GraphQL if you want more flexibility in data queries

5. Hosting / Deployment
Think about where and how youâ€™ll host it:

Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, or a static host

Backend/API: Railway, Render, Heroku, or a VPS

Database: For SQLite, use local file storage or something like Supabase/Postgres in prod

6. Tracking & Features
You might need:

Calendar view for training schedule

Charts/graphs: Add charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts, or D3)

File upload (e.g., for GPX files or images)

Offline support or PWA features (optional but useful for athletes)

Summary
Your stack is totally valid for a solo dev project or MVP:

Component	Your Choice	Good to Use?
Backend	Node.js	âœ…
Frontend	TypeScript	âœ…
Database	SQLite3	âœ… (small scale)
API style	REST (implied)	âœ…

Just keep in mind:

Add auth, UI framework, and ORM if needed

Think about data scale and portability when using SQLite

Use libraries to speed up UI/UX development
